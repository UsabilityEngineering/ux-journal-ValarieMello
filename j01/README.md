# **Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra**

This past summer I was faced with the ever inconvenient challenge of having to get a new Phone. Right in the middle of my Summer Internship and before leaving for a short trip my Phone of 2 years faced its tragic end after becoming lodged within the mechanics of my aunt's reclining couch... leaving the once sleek and pristine screen beyond shattered and internal hardware exposed. Thankfully my Manager and mentor were understanding and upon my return, I decided to replace my phone with the newest model the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. My previous phone was the S22 Ultra and while it was an excellent phone I had always felt a hole in my heart for the Note 9 which was and still is my favorite phone to this date.

A Phone is something that we use every day, some days more than others, but regardless it is something that you put a lot of miles on. It is for this reason that it makes an excellent object to study for something like examining its usability. Within this blog post, I want to discuss some of the challenges I face as a user of my new device while providing a little UX knowledge in there to make this a more well-rounded and educational read rather than just, "Val rants about the features on her expensive phone".

When I purchase a phone the key things for me are: I want to be able to take beautiful photos, have some sort of stylist for quick notes, and have easy access and use of Google services since most of what I do online is tied to the Google Suite. This naturally puts me in a place where I need to use a Samsung or some sort of Android phone. Now that we have an idea of the goals I set out to acoplish witha given device let us get into some of the interactions I have with this phone based on the goals.


Taking Beautiful Photos:

there is no denying that the S24 Ultra has an amazing camera system. However
*weird focus show screen shot
*less zoom than my previus phone
*random editing on some photos

Stylist:
works great and I like it more than the S22 where a lot of the buttons would become uncoded and I had issues with the device thinking that the pen was out and if I dropped it the pen would go flying
Has a weird smell...

Google Suit vs Samsung
*Bixby button
*Not being able to save passwords even when I sign in with samsung when on the note it used google if there was not a samsung saved
*the god damn AI button on the keyboard where emojis were for the last idk how many years

Overall my experience with the S24 Ultra is not a bad one. To borrow from my lessons
